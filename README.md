# Overview

After learning that 9th graders from Thomas Highschool cheated on their math and reading tests, I updated the code so that the metrics disregard the erroneous scores.

*How is the district and school summary affected? Overall, the disctrict and school data was not affected by new data. It is worth noting that there was some small change but that it is to insignificant to observe in the data. 

*How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? Although Thomas highschools overal passing average dropped its ranking among other schools did not change. 

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade: No 9th grade data was included for Thomas Highschool resulting in 9th grade scores. The other grade levels were not affected by this change.

## Summary

After reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs, the data was not largely affected. Although there was noticable changes in the Thomas Highschool reading and math scores, it was not signigicant enough to change the rest of the data.
